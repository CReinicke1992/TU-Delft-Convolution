# TU-Delft-Convolution
The zip file Matlab.zip contains a Matlab example that illustrates mathematical convolution. It is recommended to go through 
the file Convolution.m. All other files are required to run Convolution.m but they are not required to understand/illustrate
the process of convolution.
Note that this example is additional material to the TU Delft video tutorial on convolution. If you have any questions you can 
contact me by email: c.reinicke@tudelft.nl
